Active at minna bluff is grouped into two phases- 1.) an early phase centered at Minna Hook, 
dominated subglacial and subaerial basaltic eruptions, 2.) a later phase constructing the dominate
east-west feature of Minna Bluff. A third group, located at Minna Saddle and representing the youngest analyses is most likely
associated with parasitic activity of Mt. Discovery. 

Phase 1.
    Phase 1 began >12Ma and continued until ~8Ma.
    Early activity is dominantly subglacial. These eruptions are characterized by X to X compositions. 
    
Phase 2.
    Phase 2 started at ~8Ma and continued until ~4Ma. 
    Activity during Phase 2 is entirely subaerial with no field evidence suggesting major melt-water/ice interactions. 

The transition from phase 1 to phase 2 represents a change in the regional tectonic stress field.
