ArAr
    ar-ar analyses conducted at New Mexico geochronology research laboratory (NMGRL)
analyses measured with 3 different mass spectrometers. most analyses measured using a MAP-215-50
additional analyses where measured using one of two new next generation Thermo Argus VI mass
spectrometers.

Irradiation
    Samples irradiated in X separate irradiations. Irradiations was performed at X. See table for 
irradiation details.

MAP Details
    dual collector (faraday and analog multiplier) instrument operated in "peak hop" mode
typical map laser and furnace blanks range from X to X
    
ArgusVI Details
    six collector instrument, 5 high gain faradays and 1 ion counting multiplier. 
All Ar isotopes measured in "multicollect" mode, i.e isotopes measured simultaneously. 
typical map laser and furnace blanks range from X to X

Software
    Data Collection
        Automated data collection was accomplished using first Mass Spec then Pychron.
        see chapter 4 for detailed discussion of Pychron.
    
    Data Reduction
        Raw isotopic data was processed using the Pychron software suite.
